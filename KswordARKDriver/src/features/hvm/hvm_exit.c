 * Complete one guest HLT by entering the architectural halt state.
 *
 * Resident mode never asks for HLT exiting, but KswordARKHvmAdjustControls
 * cannot clear a bit the capability MSR reports as must-be-one, and the
 * hypervisor beneath us does exactly that: measured on nested Hyper-V, the
 * third exit of a resident guest was reason 12 from the idle loop.  Treating
 * it as unimplemented dropped the whole processor out of VMX within
 * milliseconds of VMLAUNCH - residency looked like it started and then simply
 * evaporated, with RESIDENT_ACTIVE already cleared by the time anything
 * queried it.
 *
 * The architectural answer is to retire the HLT and let VM entry put the
 * processor into the halt state, so the guest idles exactly as it asked and
 * wakes on its next interrupt.
 *
 * Retire the HLT first, then select the halt state.  An earlier revision read
 * the interrupt shadow first and, when it was set, resumed on the unretired
 * HLT expecting the shadow to expire - it does not, because the HLT never
 * completes, so the same exit repeats forever and the guest makes no progress.
 * That was a regression written to defend against a storm that a thirty-second
 * soak had already disproven: 33852 exits over 30s is roughly 1100 per second,
 * which is a healthy resident guest, not a spin.  Skipping the halt is the
 * conservative branch and it is taken only when VM entry would refuse the halt
 * state outright.
 *
 * A third-party implementation states the same symptom as an enlightened-VMCS
 * property - that HLT exiting is always delivered and cannot be disabled under
 * eVMCS.  The symptom matches what was measured here, but that attribution does
 * not hold: the TLFS enlightened VMCS field mapping carries both ProcessorControls
 * at 0x00004002 and GuestSleepState at 0x00004826, and nothing in it forces any
 * control bit to one.  What actually produces the symptom is ordinary control
 * adjustment.  The hypervisor beneath us reports HLT exiting in the allowed-zero
 * half of the capability MSR, so KswordARKHvmAdjustControls must set it however
 * little we want it - see the request site in hvm_vmcs.c, which asks for HLT
 * exiting only outside resident mode.  Nothing in this driver has ever activated
 * eVMCS: hvm_evmcs.c only performs CPUID discovery and returns
 * STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.  Keep the distinction, because an eVMCS attribution
 * would send the next reader to the wrong file.
 *
 * Two things can bring exit reason 33, invalid guest state, back.  One is moving
 * the retirement below the early returns, as described above.  The other is
 * selecting the halt state on an entry that also injects an event, since the
 * activity state and the VM-entry interruption-information valid bit constrain
 * each other.  That does not happen today because every injection path returns
 * on its own and never shares an exit with this one.
 *
 * The limit this comment used to end with - that no counter distinguished a
 * halt actually entered from one skipped by the conservative branches, so
 * there was no positive evidence the halt state was ever reached - has been
 * answered rather than repeated.  The counters exist now, the VMWRITEs on this
 * path are checked, and what they were asked to settle is settled: the
 * interrupt-shadow branch was firing on every idle HLT, because `sti; hlt`
 * puts the HLT inside the shadow by construction.

     * The gate is whether this exit's instruction, executed natively after
     * VMXOFF, means the same thing as servicing it here.  For every intercepted
     * exit it does: the instruction never executed, guest RIP still points at
     * it, and re-executing it on a machine with no hypervisor is exactly the
     * fail-open continuation the other fail-closed paths already rely on.  That
     * covers the VMX instruction exits we answer with an injected #UD too - a
     * native execution outside VMX operation raises the same #UD.
     *
     * VMCALL is the one exit where it does not.  It is the only instruction we
     * give a real meaning to (the private lifecycle contract, and the relay to
     * the L0 hypervisor), and natively it is #UD.  Leaving RIP on it and
     * dropping out of VMX turns the next native execution into a #UD - and when
     * the VMCALL came from the stop rendezvous, that #UD lands inside a
     * KeIpiGenericCall worker at IPI_LEVEL on a processor that just executed
     * VMXOFF.  Measured 2026-09-07 on 2 vCPU: Hyper-V event 18560, triple
     * fault, VM reset with no bugcheck and no dump.  So VMCALL falls through to
     * its own handler, which devirtualizes with the correct instruction length
     * and publishes the hypercall return value.  Nothing is lost by yielding:
     * the rendezvous is already walking every still-active processor, and a
     * relayed hypercall just re-enters the guest and meets this gate again at
     * its next exit.
     *
     * VMFUNC would need the same exemption for the same reason.  This version
     * never sees one - the EPTP-switching backend switches by VMWRITE from the
     * exit path and the guest issues no VMFUNC - so it is deliberately not
     * listed.  Anyone enabling a VMFUNC-based backend has to add it here.
     *
     * InstructionLength is 0 on purpose: this exit was never serviced, so the
     * intercepted instruction has to re-execute natively after VMXOFF.
     *
     * Faulted is FALSE on purpose: this processor is not the origin.  The
     * processor that failed already published FAULTED and ROLLBACK_REQUIRED,
     * and re-publishing here would make every follower look like a separate
     * fault in the telemetry.
     *
     * Read it, never consume it.  Every remaining processor has to see the same
     * request, and there is no way to know how many are still resident from
     * here.  An exchange would hand the request to whichever processor exited
     * first and hide it from the rest - correct by accident on two processors,
     * silently leaving two of four behind on a bigger box.  The flag stays up
     * until residency starts again, which is the one moment nobody is resident.
     *
     * No loop risk: a processor that takes this path leaves VMX and never
     * re-enters the dispatcher, and a failed devirtualization returns FATAL
     * rather than falling through.

         * (RDTSCP/INVPCID/XSAVES/USER_WAIT/PCONFIG) - never secondary bit 5 -
         * and VMCS field 0000H (VIRTUAL_PROCESSOR_ID) has no writer anywhere.
         * Two names mislead here and neither means "VPID is on":
         * KSW_HVM_VMX_ENABLE_VPID in hvm_runtime.c only decides whether reading
         * IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP is legal, and KSWORD_ARK_HVM_FEATURE_VPID
         * reports that the machine has the INVVPID instruction (CAP bit 32) for
         * one user interface label.
         *
         * With enable VPID clear every guest linear and combined mapping is
         * tagged VPID 0000H, and both VM exit and VM entry invalidate the
         * linear and combined mappings for VPID 0000H across all PCIDs and all
         * EPTRTA values.  SDM Vol 3C 31.4.3.1 in document 325462-092, numbered
         * 28.3.3.1 around revision 070; see docs/虚拟化规范要点.md:250.  The
         * direction is the opposite of what it looks like: an implementation
         * that enables VPID has to invalidate for itself, one that does not has
         * the hardware do it.  So the guest TLB is already empty on arrival
         * here and is emptied again on the way back, and this path touches
         * neither guest page tables nor EPT.
         *
         * Adding the instruction is not free either.  SDM 25.1.2, cited just
         * above for VMCALL, lists INVEPT and INVVPID as unconditional VM-exit
         * instructions in VMX non-root operation, and this VMX root is non-root
         * to the hypervisor beneath us - so the extra instruction buys another
         * round trip out of this partition on the hottest forwarding path.  Two
         * further reasons point the same way but were not confirmed against the
         * specification text here: VPID 0000H is reportedly the one tag INVVPID
         * cannot name, and INVVPID faults with #UD where VPID support is not
         * reported, which in VMX root is an immediate bugcheck.  This line has
         * already been burned once by a bare INVEPT.
         *
         * The one hazard that may be real is not on this processor but on the
         * remote ones, and this instruction would not address it: a sibling
         * logical processor running as our guest may hold stale translations
         * until its own next exit.  That window is bounded by the outer
         * hypervisor's own interrupt and scheduling tick, because it must
         * intercept external interrupts to schedule the virtual processor at
         * all - our own empty pin controls do not extend it.  What is genuinely
         * unknown is whether the outer flush also invalidates the nested guest
         * context, and that is unmeasured.  Its shape would be silent data
         * corruption with randomly signed bugchecks, needs two or more virtual
         * processors, and a soak that counts unexpected devirtualizations
         * cannot see it.  Measure it with a one-processor against
         * many-processor comparison before changing anything, and note that the
         * only fix that could address it - forcing every processor out before
         * returning the result - is the software rendezvous the third-party
         * implementation itself rejects as a watchdog deadlock.
         *
         * Forwarding is only meaningful when something is actually above us:
         * in root operation on a bare machine VMCALL merely VMfails, and the
         * guest would consume a fabricated result.  With no outer hypervisor
         * present the guest cannot have a hypercall page in the first place,
         * so the architectural #UD remains the correct answer there.
         *
         * Two gates, both mandatory.  Ring 3 never gets forwarded: the
         * processor performs no privilege check before this exit, so without
         * the CPL test a user-mode VMCALL would be laundered into a
         * supervisor-mode hypercall issued by us on the guest's behalf - an
         * escalation primitive the outer hypervisor would have refused itself.
         * And CPUID advertising a hypervisor is not proof that one answers
         * VMCALL, so an unserviced call falls back to the same #UD rather than
         * handing the guest its own pre-call RAX as a hypercall status.
         *
         * The interface check is the third gate and is not redundant with the
         * first.  HYPERVISOR_PRESENT is the generic CPUID.1:ECX[31] bit, while
         * the stub below hard-codes the Hv#1 register contract and overwrites
         * RAX with its unserviced sentinel.  Under an outer hypervisor whose
         * contract puts a live input in RAX, forwarding would corrupt the call
         * instead of relaying it, and residency is reachable on such a host.
         * Refusing there costs nothing: Windows builds its hypercall page only
         * after seeing the same Hv#1 signature, so a guest that does not
         * present it never issues the calls this gate turns away.

     * The guest's - Windows uses NMIs for its own watchdog and machine-check
     * paths and bugchecks on a lost one, so those go back untouched.

     * The same ledger is consumed by the assembly stub for NMIs that land while
     * this processor is in VMX root, where no exit occurs at all.  Both halves
     * claim the same way and neither can claim a credit the other already took.
     *
     * Redelivery is safe here because we do not request virtual NMIs: the NMI
     * never reached the guest, so the processor set no NMI-blocking state that
     * a re-entry with this descriptor could violate.
     *

     * guest has to resume at exactly the instruction it was about to run.
