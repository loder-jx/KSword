Module Name:

    hvm_event.c

Abstract:

    Implements a fixed nonpaged HVM event ring with sequence-validated slots.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

#include "hvm_event.h"

/*
 * Bound retained VM-exit evidence without allocation in VMX root.
 *
 * Sized from a measurement rather than a round number: a guest hypervisor
 * starting a virtual machine underneath us produced 6,960 nested-VMX events
 * before the run ended, and at 1,024 slots the whole configuration phase -
 * the part that says which fields it wrote into which VMCS - had already been
 * evicted by its own idle retry loop, leaving only the loop.  Eight thousand
 * holds that run whole.
 *
 * The cost is static: this is one nonpaged array in the image, 88 bytes a slot,
 * about 704 KiB.  Bought deliberately, because the alternative is a ring that
 * is present, healthy, never drops a write, and cannot answer the one question
 * being asked of it.
