 * EPT_TRUNCATED, and residency refused.  The user was told "处理器不支持",
 * by a processor that supports every single thing this backend needs.
 * (issue #195 是另一件事；这一条是 issue #198。)
 *
 * Sixty-four entries covers MAXPHYADDR <= 45 exactly.  It is deliberately not
 * larger: a machine reporting 46 bits will now say precisely what it needs
 * (see KSWORD_ARK_HVM_CONTROL_STATUS_EPT_WINDOW_TOO_SMALL) instead of blaming

 * down to 4 KiB, which starts from a PDE.  Windows with no installed RAM are
 * MMIO or reserved, are uniformly UC, and are published as a single one-GiB

     * The event ring cannot answer it either.  One ring is shared by every

     * 17071 dropped publications in a single run.  A ring that discards most of

     * folded into a neighbour.  ULONG, so a processor sustaining ten thousand
