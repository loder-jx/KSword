 * Build one IDT for VMX root, copied from the running one with vector 2

 *
 * Why VMX root needs its own IDT at all: an NMI that arrives while this
 * processor is in VMX root is **not** converted into a VM exit, whatever the
 * pin controls say - it is delivered through HOST_IDTR_BASE.  That has been
 * the guest's own table, whose vector 2 belongs to Windows, and Windows
 * bugchecks 0x80 on an NMI it cannot attribute to a source it knows.  So a
 * private table is a precondition for this driver ever *sending* an NMI, not
 * an optimization.  Measured 2026-09-07: the first cross-processor flush
 * attempt failed exactly this way.
 *
 * Copied rather than authored: VMX root should raise no exception at all, but
 * "should" is not a guarantee, and a table holding only vector 2 would turn any
 * mistake in the exit path into a triple fault - a reset with no bugcheck and
 * no dump, the least debuggable failure this driver can produce.  Copying keeps
 * every other vector behaving exactly as it does today, so the private table
 * changes the behavior of NMIs and nothing else.
 *
 * Selector, IST index and type/DPL/present bits are preserved from the guest's
 * own descriptor; only the 64-bit offset is rewritten.  The IST index matters
 * most: Windows runs its NMI handler on a dedicated stack, and the stub
 * forwards there, so the stack the processor switches to has to be the one
 * that handler expects.
 *
 * One table for the whole machine.  Windows keeps the same gate layout on
 * every processor - the per-processor half of a stack switch lives in that
 * processor's TSS, which the IST index selects and this table does not carry.
 *
 * Idempotent: the first processor to reach it builds the table and the rest
 * reuse it.  Callers hold the runtime lock.

     * root address may have tagged cached guest-physical translations from an
     * earlier residency - the architecture does not require VMXON to discard
     * them.  Entering with a stale tag would let the processor use mappings
     * that describe pages this hierarchy never mapped.
     *
     * This used to run only for private roots, on the stated assumption that
     * "the shared hierarchy is invalidated on every path that changes it".
     * **That assumption is false, and it was measured false.**
     *
     * The paths that change the shared hierarchy - installing an EPT rule or
     * a split view - do call KswordARKHvmResidentInvalidateEpt, but that
     * wrapper is a no-op while no processor is resident.  And a rule or a view
     * can *only* be installed while residency is stopped, because the exit
     * path reads those tables without taking the lock.  So the entire sequence
     * is: change the shared leaf, invalidate nothing, start residency, enter
     * without invalidating - and the processor keeps using translations it
     * cached under this same root during an earlier residency.
     *
     * The symptom is the worst kind this project has: a restriction that is
     * correctly written into the leaf and simply never takes effect.  Measured
     * on 2026-09-06 - the base leaf read back as execute-only
     * (0x8000000175692034, R=0 W=0 X=1) while a kernel read of that very page
     * completed and returned the real contents, with no EPT violation and no
     * exit.  It reproduced for both EPT rules and split views, and it passed
     * on an earlier run only because that run's freshly allocated page
     * happened to carry no stale tag.
     *

     * one INVEPT per entry on a path that already does far more than that.

     *
     *   - a slot's pages are a fixed slice computed from its index
     *     (hvm_ept_switch.c:127), and the pool outlives residency, so
     *     removing a view and adding another hands the new one the same slot,
     *     the same four pages, and therefore **the same EPTP bit pattern**
     *     while the tables underneath now describe a different page;
     *   - KswordARKHvmResidentInvalidateEpt cannot help: it refuses any
     *     pointer that is not the shared root (see its parameter check), so
     *     nothing on the view install or release path ever invalidates these.
     *
     * That is the 2026-09-06 defect - a restriction correctly written into a

     * root to a secondary one. It is also the stated prerequisite for opening
     * the multicore gate to this backend: do that first and the same failure
     * comes back, only now with a second processor able to observe it.

     * Slot 0 duplicates the base and is invalidated twice; INVEPT is
